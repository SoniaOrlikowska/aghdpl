\chapter{\textcolor{black}{Background}}\label{cha: Background}
In this chapter, \textcolor{black}{following subjects will be covered the :} theoretical background of maze-generating algorithms, maze-solving algorithms,
and other theoretical concepts from the graph theory required to better understand the problems included in this paper. \textcolor{black}{Moreover the concept of determining the difficulty
of a maze will be introduced}. 
\section{Graph Theory}\label{sec:theoreticalBackground}
In the following section, \textcolor{black}{it} will be discussed the graph theory's most important mathematical concepts, and a naming convention to follow in this paper will be established. 
\begin{definition}\textbf{A Set} \emph{is an object of distinct elements where no element is a set itself.\cite{Trudeau, 2017} }\end{definition}
\begin{definition}\textbf{A Graph} \emph{is an object comprising two sets called vertex set and edge set. The vertex set is finite, nonempty and the edge set may be empty. A graph usually denoted as $ G = (V, E)$ is a pair of a $V$ set of nodes (\textit{vertices}), and $E$ set of (\textit{edges}).\cite{Trudeau, 2017} }\end{definition}
\noindent In this work, three interesting subgroups of graphs will be discussed: \textcolor{black}{weighted graph,} directed graph, and cyclic graph. By applying \textit{weight} or \textit{direction} to edges of a \textit{undirected}, \textit{unweighted}, \textit{acyclic} graph presented on Figure 2.1(a), we are receiving a \textit{ weighted graph} or \textit{directed graph} presented on Figure 2.1(b). A cyclic graph consists of at least one single \textit{cycle}, which means at least 3 vertices connect in a closed chain Figure 2.1.

\section{Maze Generation Algorithms}
\textcolor{black}{This chapter describes the algorithms that were implemented for this work and were subjected to further comparative analysis. For each algorithm, there is a Listing of pseudocode provided along with a picture of the maze generated by it.}
\subsection{Binary Tree}
The Binary Tree algorithm \textcolor{black}{\cite{Cormen}} is the simplest, \textcolor{black}{fast and efficient} algorithm for generating a maze. \textcolor{black}{It doesn't require a lot of memory because it only needs to remember one cell at any time.} In a given grid, for each cell, algorithm decides whether to carve a passage north or east (or any two other directions south/west, south/east etc. ) between two adjacent cells. The algorithm produces a diagonally biased perfect maze which, in other words, is a random binary tree. For building the whole maze, the algorithm \textcolor{black}{does not} require holding the state of the whole grid. The algorithm only looks at one cell at a time. The time complexity for the Binary Tree generator is $O(|V|)$. \textcolor{black}{A pseudocode for a Binary Tree algorithm is described in Listing 2.1. Examples of mazes produced by this algorithm are presented in Figure 2.5}.

\subsection{Aldous-Broder}
The Aldous-Broder is a well-known algorithm for generating uniform spanning trees (USTs) based on random walks. This means that the maze is perfect and unbiased \cite{Nunes}. \textcolor{black}{The algorithm is highly inefficient but doesn't require a lot of memory.} In a given grid, the algorithm randomly chooses any cell, and for this cell randomly chooses a neighbour and if this neighbour \textcolor{black}{was not} previously visited, the algorithm links it to the prior cell. It is repeated until every cell has been visited. To build a spanning tree, the random walk needs to visit every vertex of the graph at least once. The time complexity for the Aldous - Broder generator is $O(|V|^3)$.\textcolor{black}{In Listing 2.2 the pseudocode for an Aldous- Broder algorithm is described. Examples of mazes produced by this algorithm are presented in Figure 2.6}

	\IF neighbour has no links
		\STATE cell.link(neighbour);

\subsection{Recursive Backtracker}

The Recursive Backtracker is one of the Depth First Search algorithm (DFS) which may be also used for generating mazes. It generates perfect mazes with a small ratio of dead ends in a maze. Its main disadvantage is that it requires a lot of memory, so it is not fast or efficient\cite{Puntambekar}. The algorithm starts at the randomly selected cell and carves its way until it must “turn around” and backtracks to the nearest “not carved yet” cell. This process continues until \textcolor{black}{it discovers} all the vertices that are reachable from the source vertex. The time complexity for the Recursive-Backtracker generator is $O(|V|+|E|)$. \textcolor{black}{In Listing 2.3 the pseudocode for a Recursive Backtracker algorithm is described. Examples of mazes produced by this algorithm are presented in Figure 2.7}

	\STATE let neighbors = current.neighbors();
		\IF neighbors.length == 0
			\STATE stack.pop()
		\ELSE 
			\STATE let neighbor = neighbors[Random]
			\STATE current.make_link(neighbor)

\section{Maze Solving Algorithms}
\subsection{Breadth-First Search Algorithm - BFS}
BFS is one of the simplest algorithms for searching a graph. As already mentioned, each maze may be considered as a graph, so from now on we will call 
BFS  a solving algorithm or simply a solver of a given maze. From graph theory, we can state that for a given graph $ G = ( V, E) $, and distinct source 
vertex $p$, BFS explores the edges of $G$ to ,,visit’ each vertex directly connected with $p$. The algorithm also produces a BFS tree with $p$ root that 
contains all reachable vertexes. The shortest path between $p$ and any vertex $v$ in $G$ is a simple path in the BFS tree, that is, a path containing
the smallest number of edges \cite{Cormen}.
\subsection{Dijkstra Algorithm}
Dijkstra is a solving algorithm for single-source shortest-path problems. We can apply it on a weighted, directed graph $G=(V, E)$ with a constraint of no negative edges. 
It repeatedly chooses the closest vertex in $V-S$ to add to set S. 
Where \textit{S} is a set of vertices whose final shortest-path weights from the source \textit{p} have already been determined.
The algorithm floods the graph so \textcolor{black}{it uses} a greedy strategy. \textcolor{black}{The Dijkstra Algorithm implemented in this work is described in Listing 2.4}.
\newline
\\
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Pseudocode for a Dijkstra’s algorithm}]
	\begin{algorithm}
	\STATE let distances = new Distances();
	\STATE let frontier = new Array();
	\WHILE unvisited cell in the grid
		\FOREACH linked cell in frontier
			\STATE linked_cell.distance = cell.distance +1;
			\STATE distances.set_cell(linked_cell);
			\STATE frontier.push(linked_cell);
	    \ENDFOREACH
	\RETURN distances;
	\end{algorithm}
	\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{A* Algorithm}
$A^*$ algorithm is one of the most powerful path-finding algorithms. It uses the same functions derived from the previously described Dijkstra Algorithm. $A^*$ combines the information that Dijkstra’s Algorithm uses, meaning choosing the vertex which is close to the starting point and additionally implementing a new type of information, which is heuristic. That means choosing nodes which are estimated to be close to the ending point $q$. 
In the standard terminology used when considering A*, $g(v)$ represents the exact cost of the path from the starting point $p$ to any vertex $v$, and $h(v)$ given by equation 2.5 describes the heuristic estimated cost from vertex $v$ to the goal $q$. In each loop, the algorithm minimizes the function $f(n)$ given by equation 2.4.\textcolor{black}{The $A^*$ Algorithm implemented in this work is described in Listing 2.5}.
\begin{equation}
f(n) = g(v) + h(v)
\end{equation}
\textbf{Where:}\\
$g(v)= |v - p| + |v - n|$\\
$|v - p|$ it's a distance from the starting point $p$ to any current vertex $v$\\
$|v - n|$ it's a distance from any current vertex $v$ to its neighbour $n$.\\
\newline
The heuristic cost from neighbour vertex $v$ to goal vertex $q$ is given as a:
\begin{equation}
h(v) = |q.x - n.x| + |q.y - n.y|
\end{equation}
\textbf{Where:}\\
$x$ and $y$ are grid coordinates of vertices\\
